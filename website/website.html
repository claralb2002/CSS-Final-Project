  <h4>Our dataset</h4>
  <p>
    Our dataset comprises the top 50 songs from each of the top 100 artists of the 2010s, as identified by Pulse Music’s ranking. For each artist, we retrieved their most popular 50 songs, resulting in a comprehensive collection of music data from the decade.
    
    To expand the dataset, we included additional attributes such as all featured artists, release year, track duration, Spotify popularity score, credited songwriters, and full song lyrics. The dataset was constructed manually using a combination of APIs, specifically the Genius API, Spotify API, and MusicBrainz API.
  </p>
  

  <h4>Why did we choose this dataset</h4>
  <p>
    We aimed to explore the relationship between popular artists, their songs, and the songwriters behind them by analyzing how artists and songs may be connected through shared songwriters or recurring lyrical themes. Additionally, we investigated how these connections might relate to a song’s popularity, whether lyrical themes are influenced by specific songwriters, and how these themes vary over time based on the release year.
    
    Our reasoning for focusing on the top 100 artists was that those who consistently appear at the top of the charts likely have greater access to resources, including the most talented songwriters. We hypothesized that this would reveal a “behind-the-scenes” network within the music industry, where a relatively small group of songwriters might be driving the success of many top-charting artists.
    
    To construct our dataset, we used the Genius API to retrieve lyrics, the MusicBrainz API to gather songwriter information, and the Spotify API to obtain additional attributes such as popularity scores, track durations, and release years.  
  
  
  </p>
  
  <h4>Our Goal</h4>
  <p>

    We had both come across discussions online and from others suggesting that many popular artists do not write their own songs, and that numerous hit songs share common songwriters. This sparked our curiosity about the structure of the music industry behind the scenes beyond the artists we see on stage or hear on the radio. Our main goal was to create an engaging and insightful exploration of the modern music landscape by uncovering hidden connections between artists, songwriters, and songs.

    To achieve this, we focused on two main areas:
    

    <ol>
      <li>
        1. Highlighting the role of songwriters: We investigated how songwriters contribute to various songs, how different top artists collaborate with them, and whether notable patterns exist in how songwriters are used across artists.
      </li>
      <li>
        2. Exploring lyrical themes and trends: We analyzed the lyrics of the songs to identify popular themes, how they vary over time, and whether they correlate with specific songwriters or popularity levels.
      </li>
    </ol>
    
    At first glance, it can be difficult to differentiate which songwriters or artists serve as the central figures in the industry and who holds the most influence. Our goal was to shed light on these influential songwriters who often operate behind the scenes. By visualizing the relationships between artists and shared songwriters, we aimed to reveal patterns of collaboration and creative networks. Using network analysis, we identified communities of artists and songs connected by common songwriters, offering a broader understanding of the structure and dynamics of the industry. Including popularity metrics enabled us to assess how success is distributed across these communities and how top artists may differ in their strategic or stylistic use of songwriters.
    
    For our second research goal, we incorporated song lyrics to conduct semantic analysis and uncover deeper thematic patterns. By examining lyrics in relation to release year and popularity, we aimed to understand how lyrical themes evolve and which topics resonate most with audiences whether that is love, heartbreak, empowerment, or social commentary. This allowed us to explore how artists and songwriters reflect cultural shifts through language. Our analysis provided insight into recurring themes, emotional tones, and linguistic trends in popular music. Finally, our goal was to give users a more interactive and meaningful way to engage with the lyrical content of songs and appreciate the creative forces behind them.

<!-- Container (DATA Section) -->
<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="constructdataset">
  <h3 class="w3-center">DATA</h3>
  
  <h4>Constructing Dataset</h4>
  <p>
    When we constructed the dataset we did it through multiple rounds. Firstly, we fetched the top 50 songs for each of the top 100 artists. To avoid loosing data, if the process for some reason was interrupted, we split the 100 artists into 2 and saved each round as a csv. Fr each of these csv files we then fecthed all lyrics and saved those as seperate csv's and repeated the process for fetching all songwriters. At the end after we had collected all data for all songs, we combined the multiple csv files into one dataset, which was saved as final_dataset.csv. Below is the 3 codes we used for fetching the data with the 3 API's.   
  </p>
  
  <h4 id="fetchsongs">Fetch Songs</h4>
  <p>
    We saved the dataframe from the previous fetching as a csv to ensure we did not loose data. Then we loaded it here to add the songwriters for each song. 
  </p>
  
  <h4 id="fetchlyrics">Fetch Lyrics</h4>
  <p>
    Here we again saved the dataframe from the previous fetching as a csv to ensure we did not loose data. Then loaded it to add the lyrics for each song. 
  </p>

  <h4 id="lyricstokenizing">Lyrics Tokenizing</h4>
  <p>
    The tokenizing of the dataset works by counting unique songs and preparing the lyrics for text analysis. Before tokenization, the lyrics are cleaned by removing section headers and artist name cues commonly found in formatted lyrics, such as [Chorus], {Bridge}, or (Verse). This is done by dropping any line that begins with a bracket, brace, or parenthesis, ensuring that only the actual lyrical content remains. We then use NLTK to download language resources and define a function to clean and tokenize lyrics by lowercasing, removing stopwords, lemmatizing, and deduplicating words. The processed tokens are added as a new column, reordered for clarity, and saved to a new CSV.  
  </p>

  
  <h4 id="cleaning">Data Cleaning and Preprocessing</h4>
  <p>
    We included data cleaning directly in each of the four steps instead of at the end, as a way of ensuring that we did not carry irrelevant data into the next step. For the dataset, we dropped any rows containing <code>NaN</code> values because we wanted all songs to contain complete features.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>SPOTIFY API</strong><br>
    When fetching the top 50 songs for the top artists, we experienced some challenges since some artists share names. This caused us to retrieve incorrect data. To resolve this, we looked up the specific Spotify artist IDs for those artists and used them to ensure accurate data retrieval.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    <strong>GENIUS</strong><br>
    The Genius API returned extra information beyond just the lyrics, such as language annotations and descriptive content tags. To clean this, we created a list of common language terms and removed any lines containing those. Similarly, descriptive lines had distinct wording patterns, allowing us to filter them out and isolate pure lyrical content for our dataset.
  </p>
  
  <h4 id="sourceoferror">Sources of error</h4>
  <p>
    We discovered during our work with the dataset that some artists names where replaced by other artists such as pink vs pink floyd and aditionally that some artists even though they appeared in the dataset were skipped in the code such as The Black Eyed Peas, U2 and fun. We also realised that we had mistakenly missed two artists "The Weeknd" and "Florida Georgia Line", which was a mistake we did not catch when fetching the dataset. Lastly. we had changed Adele's name to an ID code, but forgot to change it back afterwards, which also lead to her not being included. 
    
    Due to time restrainst at this point, we could not fetch the data again, and therefore decided to remove the problematic artists and continue without the missing artists. Furthermore, in the top 100 list there was a group based on covers of songs for kids, which we also removed from our list of top artists. This explains the missing artists in the following data stats.

<!-- ANALYSIS Section -->
<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="analysis">
  <h3 class="w3-center">TOOLS AND THEORY</h3>
  
  
  <h4>Process of theory</h4>

  <p>
    We hypothesized that many top-charting artists rely heavily on professional songwriters. This reliance might result in multiple artists sharing the same popular songwriters, which could, in turn, influence the emotional tone and themes present in their lyrics. To test this hypothesis, we constructed a custom dataset tailored to our goals, including attributes such as songs, artists, credited songwriters, popularity scores, lyrics, and release years. Before building the dataset, we carefully discussed which features were necessary to answer our research questions effectively.
    <br> <br>
    We then split our hypothesis into two distinct parts:
    <br> <br>
    <b>Structural Relationships:</b> <br>
    We explored how artists and songs are interconnected through shared songwriters. For this, we constructed two types of networks. One, where nodes represented artists or songwriters and edges represented collaborations. The second, where nodes represented songs and edges represented shared songwriters. Using community detection algorithms and network analysis, we identified clusters of artists and the most influential songwriters behind the scenes. These network visualizations helped us uncover hidden structures and collaboration patterns in the music industry. We also performed statistical analysis to complement and validate the network findings. For example comparing the number of songwriters used per artist and how this relates to popularity.
    <br><br>
    <b>Lyrical Content and Themes:</b> <br>
    To investigate how songwriters may influence lyrics, we tokenized the lyrics and used TF-IDF to identify prominent words and themes. We then compared these across different artists and further analyzed thematic differences between genres—specifically pop and rap. This allowed us to detect trends, recurring motifs, and emotional tones associated with certain songwriters or artist groups, revealing deeper connections between lyrical content and creative contributors.  
  </p>
  

  <h4>Tools</h4>

  <p>
    
    We used a combination of computational tools and techniques to process and analyze our dataset:
    <br> <br>
    <b>APIs and Data Collection:</b>
    We used the Spotify API, Genius API, and MusicBrainz API to gather the data needed for our analysis, such as song metadata, songwriters, lyrics, popularity scores, and release years.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Network Analysis:</b>
    To visualize and explore the relationships between artists and songwriters, we used the network construction tool NetworkX, and applied community detection algorithms and centrality measures. This helped us identify collaboration patterns and spotlight key figures in the music creation process.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Data Analysis and Visualization:</b>
    We used pandas and matplotlib/seaborn to analyze distributions and trends in the dataset—such as average popularity per artist or songwriter—and to create supporting visualizations.
    <br> <br>
    <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</b>
    We used NLP techniques, including tokenization and TF-IDF, to analyze the lyrical content of songs. This enabled us to identify dominant themes, compare lyrical trends across artists, and examine differences between genres like pop and rap.

<!-- NETWORK Section -->
<div class="w3-content w3-container w3-padding-64" id="download">
  <h3 class="w3-center">NETWORK</h3>
  
  
  <h4>Songwriter and artist network</h4>
  <p>
    To explore the hidden relationships between artists, songs, and songwriters, we used several tools and techniques from network science and data analysis. Our objective was to uncover collaboration patterns, detect influential individuals, and understand how songwriters connect otherwise separate artists.
    <br> <br>
    We built mulitple graphs using NetworkX. The graphs were illustrated using Netwulf, which is a Python library for interactive network visualization that integrates with NetworkX, allowing us to explore and customize graph layouts in real time through a browser-based interface. On these graphs we used community detecting in the form of the Louvain algorithm. This algorithm detects communities or clusters of nodes that are more densely connected internally than with the rest of the network. In our context, it helped us identify groups of artists that share songwriters. We then dove deeper into the actual communities looking at their density and the centrality of the nodes. We coloured the nodes based on role - songwriter, artist or both - and also based on community. 
    <br> <br>
    NetworkX gave us the tool needed to build and analyze our custom graph structures from the real-world data. The Visualization tools were essential for interpreting the data ourself and also communicating our findings to others. The Louvain Algorithm allowed us to go beyond the groupings we ourself could grasp from the graph and instead seperate them into communties to discover deeper structural groupings within the music industry. Centrality measures gave us a quantitative way to rank songwriters and understand their strategic positions in the industry.
  </p>

  <p>

    <b>Create graph</b>
    <br> <br>
    We build a collaboration dataframe to count how often a songwriter and an artist worked together. We also build a dataframe to capture the role of each node as to whether they are songwriters, artists or both. Here we discovered that the code includes some artist as both songwriters and artists due to a misspelling we missed in our initial data clean up, so they were manually fixed. 
    <br> <br>
    We used the role dataframe and collabdataframe to construct our graph and save it as a json. 
  </p>
  
<!-- Network 1 - image and text-->
  <div class="w3-center">
    <img src="/website/network_images/network2.png" alt="Semantic network" class="w3-image" style="max-width:600px; margin-bottom:16px; cursor:pointer;" onclick="onClick(this)">
    <div class="image-caption"><em>Click to enlarge</em></div>
  </div>

  <p>
    Our first network is constructed with artists or songwriters as the nodes and songs as the link between the nodes. To distinguish more easily between songwriter and artists we have colour-coded the graph such that nodes that are purely songwriters are blue, and purely artists are yellow.  A lot of artists we discovered are also credited as songwriters and these we made green. 
    We highlighted the top 10 nodes of songwriters with the most links, which are the bigger red nodes. The network contains 4578 nodes for each unique artist or songwriter and 6630 links.  
    <br> <br>
    Based on the numbers from the degree statistics, weighted degree statistics and from the visualization of the network we can see that the nodes form in a lot of big clusters centered around an artist. Most songwriters are connected to only one artist, as shown by the mode and median degree of 1 and the artists generally all have a lot of songwriters that are only connected to them. These single-link nodes tell us a lot about the music industry for the top artists, as it supports the idea that top artists often work with dedicated songwriting teams rather than widely shared contributors. It indicates that using songwriters is very common as each of these top artists seem to have their own team and also that high-profile artists tend to maintain exclusive collaborations with a select group of writers. This makes sense as we are looking at the most successful artists of the decade, who would certainly have the resources to keep such a team around themselves. 
    <br> <br>
    An important observation is the significant difference between the lowest and highest degree values in the network. The minimum degree is 0, which is a source of error as all nodes should be connected to at least one other error. However, the maximum degree reaches 165, meaning one artists or songwriter has collaborated with 165 different individuals in the network. We can look at the top 10 songwriters with the most connection:

    Here we can see that there is a stark contrast between the highest and lowest amount of links for the songwriters, which highlights the uneven distribution of influence. The vast majority of songwriters are only connected to a single artist, while a small handful of highly connected individuals play a central and disproportionately influential role in shaping the music across multiple artists and genres.
    <br> <br>
    These top 10 songwriters also share a lot of attributes. They are all producers, who work behind-the-scenes across a variety of genres. While some of them such as Pharrell Williams and Max Martin has appeared in the music industry for a long time other are more recent additions such as Finneas.

  <h4>Community detection</h4>

  <p>
    We use community detection on the graph to support our conclusions from the previous graph.

  </div>

  <p>
    The conclusion from the previous graph is supported, when we use Louvain community detection on network as seen in the graph above, where all the communities are colored in. Here we can again see how the communities are formed around a central artist with that artists team of songwriters appearing as a cloud around them.

    Using the Louvain algorithm, we identified 34 distinct communities in our artist–songwriter network. These communities represent clusters of closely interconnected artists and songwriters—groups that collaborate frequently. The community sizes vary significantly, ranging from very small, tightly knit groups such as Community 33 with 11 nodes to much larger clusters like Community 14 with 439 nodes. This variation reflects the diversity in collaboration intensity and artistic reach among artists.
    <br> <br>
    Most communities have moderately low density between 0.009–0.020, indicating that while nodes are clustered, not every artist collaborates with all others in their community. Community 14, which includes Nicki Minaj, Drake, and Cardi B, is the largest with 439 nodes but it has a very low density 0.005, suggesting a sprawling but loosely connected network. Possibly a reflection of the wide range of high-profile artists in hip hop and pop. In contrast, Community 33, which includes Mumford & Sons, has only 11 nodes but the highest density 0.182, reflecting a small, tightly collaborating circle, which is a pattern that is more often seen in niche or genre-specific groups like folk or indie.
    <br> <br>
    The large, low-density communities often feature superstar artists with broad networks of collaborators Drake, Beyoncé, Kanye West. These artists might work with many different songwriters, but those writers may not collaborate with each other, resulting in lower internal density. The smaller, high-density communities more often represent bands or tightly-knit genre groups, where collaboration is more frequent and concentrated among the same members.
    <br> <br>
    Additionally from the community coloured graph we can also more easily see that there exists a lot of floating nodes, which do not seem to be connected to only one of these songwriter clouds, which indicates that there is still a network of more collaborative songwriters being slightly blocked from view by the clouds of single-link songwriters. In order to bring this hidden structure more towards the surface we reduce the network.
