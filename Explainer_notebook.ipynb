    "We wanted to research what the connection between present day artists or songs was by looking at how the artists and songs might be connected by common songwriters or lyrics. We wanted to expand this research by both looking at what connection this might have to the popularity of the song and how the themes in the lyrics might be influenced or depend on the songwriters and how these themses vary and change depending on the release year. \n",

    "We decided to use a list of the top 100 artists from pulse music in order to narrow down the artists to look at. Here our thought process was that the artists with the most means and oppertunities would be the ones the most popular and the ones appearing in the top 50. These artists would have the most ressources to bring in the best songwriters which could possibly create a network behind the scenes of the music industry with these songwriters being the mastermind of the most famous artists. \n",

    "#### What was your goal for the end user's experience?\n",
    "\n",
    "We had both heard a bit here and there on the internet and through other people that a lot of popular artists do not write their own songs and that many popular songs share common songwriters. It made us curious to actually map out how music industry was structured behind the scenes of the most popular artists that we are presented with on the stage and in the radio. The main goal has been to give the end user an engaging and insightful exploration of the music landscape by uncovering the hidden connections between artists, songwriters and songs. To achieve this we have focused in on 2 different areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Highlighting songwriters, how they are used by different artists and the difference here between top artists.\n",
    "2. Determining popular themes and trends in songs and whether they depend on the songwriter\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " On the surface it might not be clear which artists are actual central nodes and which artist or songwriters have the most influence. Here, we try to highlight the most influential songwriters who play a significant role behind the scenes. We aimed to visualize how some artists are also interlinked through shared songwriters, enabling users to discover collaborative patterns and creative networks. We aimed to identify and map potential communities within the artist and song networks connected by songwriters and thereby offering users a broader understanding of the structure and dynamics of the music industry. By including popularity we also had a way of defining succes in these communities. The dataset and network enabled us to compare of how the different top artists utilize songwriters, possibly revealing strategic or stylistic differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second goal we include the lyrics of the songs in order for us to do semantic analysis to uncover thematic patterns to add to the end user's experience. By analyzing lyrics based on their release year and popularity levels, we aimed to reveal how themes evolve and what actually resonates with the audience — such as shifting from love and heartbreak to empowerment or social commentary. This allows users to explore how artists and songwriters reflect cultural changes through language. With the lyrics we provide insights into what recurring motifs, emotional tone, and general language trends are present in the lyrics. Ultimately, the goal was to let users interact with the lyrical content on a deeper level. "

Lastly we also ran had changed some Adele's name to an ID code, but forgot to change it back afterwards, which also lead to her not being included. Due to time restrainst at this point, we could not fetch the data again, and therefore decided to remove the problematic artists and continue without the missing artists.
